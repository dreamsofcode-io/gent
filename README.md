# Gent

Gent is an A.I. tool for generating git commit messages based on
your staged files.

All you need to do to use gent is to stage any files you want 
to be commited, using `git add` followed by running `gent commit`.

Upon doing so, a commit message will be generated based on those changes
and previewed to you. If you're happy with the commit, then you can accept
and gent will commit the changes for you.
